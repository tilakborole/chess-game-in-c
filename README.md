# chess-game-in-c
A terminal based chess game developed in C as a part of data structures and algorithms project. Two player mode works fine with some minor implementations remaining and problem while detecting checkmate sometimes. Can play with computer but CPU just checks for knocking move randomizes the move (not so intelligent);
